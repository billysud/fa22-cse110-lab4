# Lab 4 part 3
1. Its asychronous nature follows from the fact that we can do callback(). We may sometimes need to fetch data and that could take some time
so it is only natural that we need to have this sort of nature. But it can be a pain since data comes in big and small sizes and trying to anticipate
how long it will take is something we have to consider using the setTimeout() so this can be a pain. The loose typing is something that JS and Python
both share and can be hard for new learners to understand since it is not easily distinguished. Also when debugging it is harder on someone reviewing
your code since they may not be 100% sure on the typing. I think its pretty crazy JS only runs on web browsers. I think that is a pain since it cannot
be experiemented with outside a browser and to have a real-time compiler like VS code would be really helpful to just see and test results.

2. I think the creater made it loosely-typed so that it can interpret better and not throw errors and crash on every single line of code. As for the
asynchronous nature I'm not too sure. Maybe it was a safe design decision just in case code needed to wait to be executed.

3. Looking from the internet a compiled language seems to be something like C++ or Java since we can type it in, compile and run the code. While
interpreted languages run while you are typing and will adapt to what you do. JS is an interpreted language since it well interprets everything you
write from the data types to the parenthesis and even then semicolons. I think the benefit is that JS is adaptabile since you can easily change one
thing and not have to stop recompile and run. The changes would just happen which is great for webpages. The downside of course is that you can easily
easily break a webpage when a young dev doesn't know exactly what they're doing.

4. I think focusing on vanilla JS is very important since it is the foundation of all the frameworks. Some of the benefits if we get good at JS we are able to easily
learn or translate to other frameworks. Much like how in high school/college we learn languages that derive from Latin. The drawbacks of not learning
a framework is that we don't get to put it on our resume (yet). 

5. This lab will be the heart of our project. Projects that we are given in this class NEED functions and NEED logic to work and JS will be the 
provider of those things. Our project is going to be a music note taking app and I think we can use JS to prompt the users when to take a note and
even down to how the UI transitions to another.
